# network-intrusion-detection
Deep Learning based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) that analyzes network traffic features and classifies connections as normal or malicious using a neural network model. The system includes a Streamlit dashboard for real-time monitoring and prediction visualization.
Network Intrusion Detection System using Deep Learning

This project implements a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) using Deep Learning techniques to identify malicious activities in network traffic. The system analyzes multiple network connection features and classifies traffic as normal or anomalous.

The project also provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard where users can input network parameters and view prediction results with confidence scores.

Model Architecture

The system uses a Deep Neural Network with the following structure:

Input Layer: 41 features

Hidden Layer 1: 128 neurons (ReLU + Dropout)

Hidden Layer 2: 64 neurons (ReLU + Dropout)

Hidden Layer 3: 32 neurons (ReLU)

Output Layer: Softmax classification

The model is trained to detect normal traffic and intrusion attempts.

Dataset

The model is trained using the KDD Cup 99 network intrusion detection dataset, which contains labeled network traffic data including multiple types of cyber attacks.
